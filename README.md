Here is a sample story generated from A Christmas Carol:

    in the dining-room, sir, along with you! retorted peter, grinning. it's just as a schoolboy. i am now to you, and i release you. with a thing like a bad lobster in a most illustrious laugh. the father of a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares long, long, forgotten! your lip is trembling, said the ghost. a tremendous family to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a hut, and swiftly they advanced towards it the centre of a thousand odours floating in the hall cried, bring down master scrooge's box, there! and in the air; incoherent sounds of lamentation.
